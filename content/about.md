# Background
Hey there! My name is Cody Oss and I am a software engineer that lives in Minneapolis, MN. I hail from a smaller town 
in ND called Grand Forks. It is here where I was born, raised, attended university, and met my lovely wife. The university
I attended was The University of North Dakota. I started off college as a double major in music. After some time and
deep thought though I decided I wanted to keep music as more of a hobby. It was then I decided I should take a shot at
computer science. I always loved technology growing up and computers always interested me, so why not right? Turns out
I really liked it so I kept pursuing it while still do some music on the side. I would eventually graduate with a
major in both Computer Science and Music.

# Life after college
After college I got my first job at a health start-up in Fargo, ND call Intelligent InSites.  After working there a 
couple years, and learning a bunch, I decided it was time to try something new in a bigger city with a more vibrant
tech community; this is what brought me to Minneapolis where I currently work at a company called SPS Commerce.
