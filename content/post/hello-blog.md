Well the time has finally come. There comes a point in every developers career where he/she decides it is time to step
up, take action, and make a blog! Today is that day for me.

## Introduction
### Who am I?
Well my name is Cody Oss and I am a software engineer that lives in Minneapolis, MN. I was born and raised in
a smaller town in North Dakota called Grand Forks. It was there where I also attended university at The University of
North Dakota!(Go, Sioux) After graduating I took my first position in Fargo, ND at a healthcare start-up called
Intelligent InSites. After working there a couple years, and learning a lot, I decided it was time to move on to
something bigger and badder; that place for me was SPS Commerce in Minneapolis. At SPS I work on the Commerce Engine
team supporting legacy Oracle products while building out new custom cloudy solutions to replace them. While on the 
job, I primarily work with Java and Python. At home I am obsessed with learning any and everything about Golang. When
not working I enjoy: playing some frisbee golf, hanging out with my wife, binge watching Netflix and the likes, taking
my dog Meeko out on walks, playing video games, and playing music.

## Purpose
### So why start a blog?
That is a great question. Well for one I consider myself a TERRIBLE reader/writer.(sorry for the caps but it is true)
I would like to get better at writing and explaining technical things to people. Another reason is that I like to
help people learn. Before going into programing I always thought it would be fun to be a teacher. So with this blog I
would like to try to give back to the the greater community at large and share interesting things I learn about.

### What types of content will this blog cover?
Hmmmm... I don't know yet, sorry! The following are categories I am considering to cover more on in the future:
Programming, Lifestyle, Reviews, Tutorials, and Potpourri!

## Wrap-up
Well that's it! Stay tuned for my first real posts in the coming weeks. I figure it will be on something rated with
Golang. At the time of writing this I am two days away from leaving for GopherCon!(I'm pumped) Cody out. `$ exit`
